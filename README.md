Instructions for git hub
  You will have a branch
  push to your branch
  pull before you start working
  
  "//" = comments
  pull = git pull origin <branch name> // explecitly pull from the master branch
  add = git add* // adds entire working directory to staging
  commit = git commit // a new dialogue thing will apear using vi. add a message the press ^o, enter, ^x
  push = git push origin <branch name> // send your commit to git hub
